# Unable to Access Project Files

I cannot read the zip file you've attached - it appears to be a binary archive that I cannot decode. To provide you with comprehensive design guidelines, I need information about your project.

## Please Provide:

**Project Information (choose one method):**

1. **Text Description:**
   - What type of application/website is this?
   - What is its primary purpose?
   - Who are the target users?
   - Key features or sections needed?

2. **Extract and Share:**
   - Extract the zip file and share key files as text (HTML, CSS, configuration files)
   - Share screenshots of existing designs
   - Paste any existing documentation

3. **Project Brief:**
   - Industry/category (e-commerce, SaaS, portfolio, etc.)
   - Specific design inspiration ("like Airbnb", "minimalist", "bold/modern")
   - Must-have pages/sections
   - Any existing brand guidelines (fonts, spacing preferences)

## What I Need to Create Guidelines:

- **Project Type:** Landing page? Web app? Dashboard? E-commerce?
- **Content Scope:** What pages/sections does it include?
- **Visual Direction:** Any reference sites or aesthetic preferences?
- **Special Requirements:** Forms, galleries, data visualization, etc.?

Once you provide this information in a readable format, I'll generate detailed design guidelines covering typography, layout systems, component specifications, and visual hierarchy tailored to your project.
